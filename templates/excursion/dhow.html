                    <p>The Zanzibar sunset cruise begins when you board a dhow at a nearby beach. A variety of Snacks, beer and soft drinks are served. These are perfectly chilled to your liking. The sail takes you on a round trip to Zanzibar. This is another side of Zanzibar from the ocean. The guides will point out the attractions from the boat. <br><br>Info and stories are told the same. Enjoy some music as the dhow glides further into the sea. Sit back, enjoy and relax. The quiet sea and cool breeze will enlighten your spirit. It is an awesome feeling. After you step on-board the vessel, the skilled crew on board take the dhow about 1km away from the shore by means of an engine, once out in the sea the engine is shut off and during a tense moment the skillful crew put up the sail, once the sail is in favor of the wind, the guest can sit back, relax and enjoy the peacefulness of the ocean as you hear the ripple of water on the sides of the dhow as it glides swiftly through the clear turquoise water. <br><br>  
Your breath will be taken away by the wonder of the fiery golden-sun setting beyond the horizon as it makes the sky a magical canvas of shades of pinks, purples, blues and orange. As you head back for stone town the wind gently blows into the Latin sail which is truly mesmerizing. Our sunset cruises leave Stone Town in the late afternoon to cruise along the coast, slicing through the clear turquoise water.
